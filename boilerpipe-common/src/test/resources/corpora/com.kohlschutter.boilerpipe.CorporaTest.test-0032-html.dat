</blockquote><p>House Minority Leader&nbsp;<a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/pelosi-statement-prime-minister-netanyahus-address-congress/" target="_blank">Nancy Pelosi</a> also immediately panned the substance of Netanyahu's remarks.</p><p>Within minutes of the end of the speech, she issued a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/pelosi-statement-prime-minister-netanyahus-address-congress/" target="_blank">statement</a> saying that she had been "near tears throughout the Prime Minister's speech — saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations [leading Iran talks], and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation."</p><h3>Why Democrats are so angry about Netanyahu's speech</h3><p>Democrats have been furious about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8130977/netanyahu-speech-explained" target="_blank">Netanyahu addressing Congress</a> ever since the speech was announced in January. They perceive Netanyahu as not only trying to undermine President Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, but also Obama's authority over US foreign policy.</p><p>Part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/2/8130977/netanyahu-speech-explained" target="_blank">problem</a> is that Netanyahu went behind the White House's back to set up the speech. House Majority Leader John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress without consulting or even notifying the White House about the invitation. The Israelis and the Republican leadership intentionally kept the White House out of the loop:&nbsp;<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/boehner-netanyahu-speech-white-house" target="_blank">Boehner</a> said they wanted to make sure that there was "no interference" from the administration.</p><p>Although Boehner's office did notify the White House before issuing a "formal invitation" to Netanyahu, by that point the deal was done.</p><p>The speech was a major breach of protocol for both Israel and the Republican party. It was a breach of diplomatic protocol for Israel's leadership to work directly with an opposition party in that way. And it was a breach of political protocol for the Republicans to go behind the president's back to work directly with a foreign leader, because the president is supposed to be the US's sole organ in foreign affairs.</p><p>Both breaches were particularly egregious in this case, because they were intended to directly undermine Obama's ongoing diplomatic efforts on Iran.</p><p>That's why at least 55 Democrats announced plans to&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/news/234398-bibi-boycott-grows-ahead-of-address" target="_blank">boycott</a> the speech before it happened — and why the White House and the Democratic leadership have been so quick to denounce it now.</p><h2>In this StoryStream</h2>
