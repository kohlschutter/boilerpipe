Here in Maryland, a group of state lawmakers is once again pushing to legalize marijuana in our state, and the latest Goucher Poll suggests that a majority of Marylanders support legalization. The poll found that 52 percent support making the use of marijuana legal, while 44 percent oppose it.
 
Delegate Curt Anderson, D-Baltimore, and State Senator Jamie Raskin, D-Montgomery County, introduced companion bills in the House and Senate that would make marijuana use legal for adults. The bills would also tax and regulate marijuana similar to alcohol.
 
The results of the Goucher Poll of Maryland residents line up with national polling on the issue.

"In the last couple years, you finally see that public opinion jump that gets you over that 50 percent mark, so right around 2012 to 2013, nationwide, more people support the legalization than oppose it," said Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College. "Years prior, it was the other way around." 
 
The poll found that 55 percent of respondents do not believe marijuana is a gateway drug--leading to the use of hard drugs.
 
When asked which substance was most harmful to a person's overall health, just eight percent said marijuana is more harmful than tobacco, alcohol or sugar. Tobacco received the most votes at 46 percent, followed by alcohol at 22 percent and sugar at 13 percent.
 
Though public support seems to be increasing for the legalization of marijuana, these bills face uphill battles. Two previous efforts to pass similar bills in the Maryland General Assembly failed.
