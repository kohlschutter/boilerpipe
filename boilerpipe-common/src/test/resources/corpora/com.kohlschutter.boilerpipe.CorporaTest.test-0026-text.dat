(Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, directly challenging President Barack Obama in a speech to U.S. lawmakers, said an emerging agreement with Iran would backfire and ensure the Islamic Republic gains a nuclear arsenal.
“That deal would not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons -- it would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them,” Netanyahu said Tuesday in Washington, speaking to a joint meeting of the U.S. House and Senate in an effort to head off an accord being negotiated between Iran and world powers. “It paves Iran’s path to the bomb.”
Within hours of Netanyahu’s speech, Obama shot back that “as far as I can tell, there was nothing new” in the remarks.
“It paves Iran’s path to the bomb.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
“On the core issue, which is how to we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the prime minister didn’t offer any viable alternatives,” the president told reporters at the White House.
Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to address Congress without consulting Obama’s administration, adding to tensions with an ally that provides $3.1 billion a year in military aid to Israel.
Obama has said he isn’t inviting Netanyahu to the White House because the visit is just two weeks before Israel’s March 17 election.
“I deeply regret the fact that some perceive my being here as political,” Netanyahu, 65, told lawmakers. “That was never my intention.”
No Alternative
An Obama administration official said after the speech that Netanyahu demanded that Iran simply capitulate. That isn’t a plan and wouldn’t win support from other nations, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.
The speech, which at least 40 Democratic lawmakers skipped in protest, only heightened divisions in Congress over the nuclear talks.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, the chamber’s top Democrat, called Netanyahu’s remarks an “insult to the intelligence of the United States,” saying she was “saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.”
Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised the speech, which he said “crystallized a lot of thinking.” He said Netanyahu helped make the case for legislation that would require congressional approval before sanctions on Iran are lifted.
Thousands of Centrifuges
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Senate will debate the bill sponsored by Corker next week. The administration has said Obama would veto it if it’s sent to his desk and lawmakers may not have enough votes to override the president.
Netanyahu said an accord would leave Iran with a “vast nuclear” program. He said thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium “would be left spinning” and “thousands more would be temporarily disconnected but not destroyed.”
“This is a bad deal,” Netanyahu said. “This is a very bad deal. We’re better off without it.”
Instead, he said, a better deal can be obtained by “keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.”
Saying that Iran is “gobbling up” nations from Iraq to Yemen, Netanyahu said the world powers should insist that Iran “change its behavior” during the course of any nuclear agreement, if not before a deal is signed.
Regime Change
The Obama administration official said Netanyahu essentially is demanding regime change in Iran rather than a negotiated deal. Unless the Iranian government were overthrown, the official said, the options would be to accept a nuclear-capable Iraq or take military action that would set back the Iranian nuclear program for a much shorter time than a negotiated agreement.
Netanyahu’s political opponents in Israel called his speech a blatant campaign gimmick in a race where the prime minister is trailing and condemned him for scarring Israel’s ties with Obama.
“There’s no question that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows how to give a good speech,” said Isaac Herzog, head of the Zionist Union that narrowly leads Netanyahu’s Likud party in pre-election polls.
“But let’s be frank, the speech that we heard today, as impressive as it was, won’t stop a nuclear Iran, and it will not influence a nuclear deal,” Herzog said in a speech broadcast in Israel on Channel 2 television.
Standing Ovation
Netanyahu drew a standing ovation when he entered a House chamber and dozens more during the speech as he denounced Iran.
“Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-semitism with the newest technology,” he said. “He tweets that Israel must be annihilated.”
Among guests for the speech were Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and Nobel peace prize winner; lawyer Alan Dershowitz; New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and billionaire Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and backer of Republican candidates and pro-Israel causes.
During Netanyahu’s address, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was meeting in one-on-one talks with Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on a nuclear deal in Montreux, Switzerland. The talks, in their second day, came as Iranian leaders made statements readying their nation for a resolution to the decade-long dispute.
Israeli Airstrikes
Netanyahu in the past has threatened Israeli airstrikes to thwart Iran, though it would take U.S. military capabilities to do more than delay an Iranian effort to develop nuclear weapons.
The U.S. and its allies say Iran has been seeking the capability to build nuclear weapons. The Islamic Republic says its program is purely for peaceful, civilian purposes.
Israel is widely thought to possess its own nuclear arsenal, although it has never acknowledged that or signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Before arriving in the U.S. on March 1, Netanyahu set off alarms when a senior official on his plane told reporters that the prime minister would reveal details of the Iran agreement that would demonstrate why Israel was spurning the deal. After Kerry expressed concern that he would disclose U.S. secrets, Netanyahu said in the speech that he didn’t need to.
“While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record,” Netanyahu said. “You don’t need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it.”
