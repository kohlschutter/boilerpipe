   The Federal Communications Commission will not release the text of its new net neutrality rules today&nbsp;even if the new policy is approved, a senior FCC official told Motherboard.

  In fact, it could take weeks before the final rules are published, the official said. That’s because the two Republican commissioners, Ajit Pai and Mike O’Rielly—who oppose net neutrality of any sort—have refused to submit basic edits on the order.

This will depend on&nbsp;how long the GOP commissioners refuse to provide edits on the new rules.</p><p>The FCC will still hold a press conference with reporters this afternoon to brief everyone on the new rules, even though the exact text of the final order is on hold.</p><h3>&quot;
