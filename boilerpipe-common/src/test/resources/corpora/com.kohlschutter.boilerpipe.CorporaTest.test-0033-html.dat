For those who are homeless or precariously housed it’s often a time to prepare for the ultimate survival test – staying alive.</p><p>But staying alive in the cold isn’t easy. A number of places in the United States battered by the harsh winter have reported hypothermia related deaths of people living in abandoned buildings and on the streets. Last month in Memphis, Tennessee a <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/feb/18/six-people-killed-during-winter-weather-tennessee/288986/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">homeless man froze to death</a> just hours after he was turned away from a local shelter, and a <a href="http://www.riverheadlocal.com/2015/02/20/death-homeless-man-greenport-spotlights-crisis-many-without-shelter-bitter-cold-winter-weather/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">homeless man in Greenport, New York</a> met a similar fate trying to survive in an uninsulated garage he’d converted into a temporary home . This January in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/deaths-of-2-men-during-cold-snap-prompt-call-for-action-1.2891428" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">two homeless men died</a> on cold winter nights. Both men had sought refuge in the only shelter they could find: a bus stop and an abandoned truck.</p><p>Cold weather related deaths of those who are homeless or poorly housed are by no means a uniquely North American experience. In fact, it appears to be a truly global phenomenon of significant proportions.</p><p>In February 2012, during a six week deep-freeze, Eastern Europe saw staggering numbers of <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/13/at-least-600-across-europe-die-in-deep-freeze-215-in-russia-alone/" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">deaths</a> of homeless people: more than 200 in Russia, 74 in Romania, 135 in the Ukraine and 82 in Poland. Last year, the United Kingdom saw a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/11382808/Winter-death-toll-to-exceed-40000.html" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">30% increase in “excess winter deaths”</a> with an alarming 7,000 of those attributable to poor housing stock and to “fuel poverty”, where soaring gas and electricity prices force people on low and fixed incomes to make impossible choices: to eat or heat.</p><p>Even some of the most unlikely places are not immune from cold weather deaths of homeless people. In January 2013 northern India saw a jump in <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/cold-wave-intensifies-death-toll-reaches-40/article1-981829.aspx" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">fatalities</a>. Antarctic cold snaps in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10679088" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">Argentina</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-18765778" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">Chile</a> in 2010 resulted in the deaths of several homeless people. And this winter at least three Palestinians in <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/.premium-1.636366" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">Gaza</a>, including two infants, died in conditions of extreme cold and flooding as a result of the destruction of their homes during the military offensive they endured last summer.</p><p>None of these deaths make sense. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/winter" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class=" u-underline">Winter</a> is, after all, a cyclical thing: not only expected, but guaranteed. And the extreme cold weather that often accompanies winter is foreseeable, as is the vulnerability to hypothermia, and illness leading to death for those with no housing or poor housing.</p><p>Despite all of this predictability, despite the obvious security threat posed by winter, cold-weather deaths continue. What’s particularly striking is the general lack of concern for those who are at risk of dying.</p><p>It seems we’ve come to expect that our governments will protect some security interests but not others. These winter deaths should not be blamed solely on the cold weather, but rather also on governments who fail to assume responsibility for the poor and homeless.</p><p>If governments don’t want to be implicated in these deaths, they must, at the very least, institute a zero-tolerance policy for preventable cold-weather deaths. In the short term, this may mean subsidizing heating costs for those who are poor, and making available adequate emergency services that provide shelter while maintaining the dignity of every individual who makes use of them. In the longer term, governments must adopt housing strategies that demonstrate an understanding of the intersections between housing, and other economic and social policies, human security, and human rights.</p><p>Commitments such as these must be made now, in the dead of winter, before the warm summer winds lull us back into the cycle of denial.</p>
